<h1>The Problem Solving Framework : 'UPER'</h1>

* U = "Understand"
* P = "Plan"
* E = "Execute"
* R = "Reflect" / "Refactor"

<h2>1. Understanding the Problem</h2>

Two pages. {One : storepage ; Two : cart}
Need to find out how to change pages || Make a small window that can overlay the current screen.
Cart needs and option to purchase objects, check paypal, they have a simple port solution.

Inventory management system that can +/-, also send object to a cart[]
limited amount of stock available to store, min.10

Need a search fucntion that can find objects in storeRepo

Each object needs five attributes Product.{Name, serialNumber, Price, Manufacturer, category}


userCart must be able to hold multiples of any item. 


<h2>
    2. Planning the Solution
</h2>
Make wireframe of site. One page || two




Need a place to store the stockItems
  -Try the Web Storage API 
  -Else an [] that holds objects


Need components for 
    -search/filter functionality
    -Items to be sold
        -Objects of items
    -userCart 

Will need a theme for site, Not necessary to see if components will work.
try nice a* pens

<h2>
    3. Executing the Plan

    []Cart,  right side
        []Holds a list of current items added from storeInventory
        []Subtotal for items 
        []buy button (paypal has a button generator; is in html. May cause issues if imported into react.js)
    []Filters,  left side
        Filters for different tags on items 
    []flex grid for sales items, in center
